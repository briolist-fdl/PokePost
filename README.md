# PokéPost

PokéPost is a Discord bot for clean Pokémon GO friend code posting.

It lets players create and manage a structured friend code profile, then posts the profile in dedicated Discord channels without turning the channel into a chat feed.

## Features

* Create a Pokémon GO friend code profile
* Store Pokémon GO username, trainer code, Vivillon pattern, and optional Campfire username
* Add up to three additional friend codes
* Edit, view, repost, or delete your saved profile
* Change Vivillon region
* Turn follower republishing on or off
* Post to dedicated Tundra and international friend code channels
* Optional automatic bumping/reposting system. Public posts show a single linked Discord username instead of a user mention, without a mention ping. Automatic bumps suppress push notifications; unread indicators may still appear. Other posts follow normal channel notification settings.
* PostgreSQL-backed profile storage
* Ephemeral command responses for user actions

## Main command

PokéPost uses one main slash command:

```text id="bcwuxr"
/post
```

### Profile setup

```text id="aljqq7"
/post setup
```

Opens a profile form; no slash-command arguments are required. `/post edit` opens
the same form with saved values. Running setup when a profile already exists opens
that profile for editing and preserves its additional codes.

Required fields:

```text id="yck75s"
pokemon_username
trainer_code
vivillon_pattern
publish_to_followers
```

Optional field:

```text id="8p9j0d"
campfire_username
```

Vivillon region and republishing consent use dropdowns in the form. New profiles
require an explicit yes/no republishing choice. Submission returns a private
confirmation and preview. Changing region publishes in the new channel before
removing the old post. If publishing fails, the saved profile is retained and the
private reply explains how to retry.

This UI change still uses the current home-server profile storage. The separate
multi-server model and optional-profile-info button are not activated by this
release. It needs command re-registration as well as deployment. Forms opened
before the update must be reopened. The locked discord.js version supports modal
Labels and String Select components; no dependency update is required.

### Profile management

```text id="uoevyq"
/post view
/post edit
/post delete
/post repost
```

These commands let users inspect, update, delete, or repost their saved profile.

### Additional friend codes

```text id="57x4i4"
/post add-code
/post remove-code
```

Users can add or remove extra trainer codes from their profile.

### Republishing

```text id="bpi79z"
/post republishing
```

Turns follower republishing on or off.

### Vivillon region

```text id="hzluu8"
/post region
```

Changes the saved Vivillon pattern for the user profile.

## Moderator region correction

`/post admin region user:<member> vivillon_pattern:<region>` corrects a saved profile.
It requires **Manage Messages** at runtime. The
runtime check uses the member's effective permissions in the command channel,
including channel overrides. Administrator also grants access. Until
profiles are server-scoped, it only operates in `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` (the home server).
The profile owner does not need to be the person running the command.

The `/post` root remains available to regular users. Discord command-level default
permissions apply to the whole root, so admin subcommands rely on the runtime
permission check rather than restricting all profile commands. The admin group
may be visible to users who cannot run it.

The post is edited in place when its destination stays the same. Otherwise a new
post is saved in the correct configured channel before the old post is removed.
Missing old posts are recreated. Codes, republishing preference and bump timestamps
are retained; the correction removes the automatic `bumped` marker. No profile is deleted.

The bot needs View Channel and Read Message History in the source, and View Channel
and Send Messages in the destination. It only edits/deletes its own stored post.
No mentions are notified by this command. Posts in followed servers may not be
updated or removed when an announcement post is corrected.

Moderation events are JSON records with `event=poke_post_moderation` in the hosting
logs (Railway). They include moderator/user/server IDs, old/new region and message
references, timestamp and outcome, but no trainer codes. Access to these logs should
be restricted to staff; retention follows the hosting log settings. No separate
Discord audit channel is created by this version.

If old-post cleanup fails, the private reply links to the remaining post. If a
database commit cannot be confirmed, the command asks staff to check before retrying.
Discord and PostgreSQL do not share a transaction, so these partial failures require
manual review. Avoid concurrent profile edits while a moderator correction is running.

This feature needs a code deploy **and explicit slash-command registration** before
use. It needs no schema migration or new environment variables.

## Requirements

* Node.js
* PostgreSQL database
* Discord bot application
* Discord server where slash commands can be registered
* Dedicated Discord channels for configured friend code feeds

## Environment variables

PokéPost is configured through environment variables.

```env id="bdnyav"
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=
DEPLOY_GLOBAL_COMMANDS=
DATABASE_URL=

INTERNATIONAL_CHANNEL_ID=
TUNDRA_CHANNEL_ID=

BOT_ID=poke-post
SUPPORT_MESSAGES_ENABLED=true
```

`DEPLOY_GLOBAL_COMMANDS=true` is only needed when deploying slash commands globally for public bot usage.

Optional bump/repost settings:

```env id="rblbcm"
BUMP_ENABLED=false

BUMP_TUNDRA_INTERVAL_HOURS=24
BUMP_TUNDRA_COUNT_PER_RUN=1
BUMP_TUNDRA_COOLDOWN_DAYS=5

BUMP_INTERNATIONAL_INTERVAL_HOURS=11
BUMP_INTERNATIONAL_COUNT_PER_RUN=3
BUMP_INTERNATIONAL_COOLDOWN_DAYS=3
```

Optional support-message override:

```env id="2zf7xa"
SUPPORT_MESSAGE_CHANCE=
```

`SUPPORT_MESSAGE_CHANCE` is intended for testing or temporary override only. Do not set it permanently unless you specifically want to override the bot default.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Deploy slash commands to the configured development/test guild:

```bash
npm run deploy-commands
```

Deploy slash commands globally for public bot usage:

```bash
DEPLOY_GLOBAL_COMMANDS=true npm run deploy-commands
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:DEPLOY_GLOBAL_COMMANDS="true"
npm run deploy-commands
Remove-Item Env:\DEPLOY_GLOBAL_COMMANDS
```

Guild deploy is useful for testing because commands update quickly. Global deploy is needed when the bot is installed in other servers.

Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

## Database

PokéPost uses PostgreSQL.

The database connection is read from:

```env id="yqlp1b"
DATABASE_URL=
```

The bot stores user profile data needed to create and manage friend code posts.

## Permissions

PokéPost needs the Discord permissions required to:

* use slash commands
* send messages in configured friend code channels
* edit or delete bot-created profile posts when users update/delete their profile
* send messages in configured group threads when a server enables thread routing

During `/post admin server`, administrators can choose whether the selected feeds stay clean. When enabled, PokéPost removes regular messages from those feeds, posts a short instruction to use `/post setup`, then removes that instruction automatically. This option requires **Manage Messages** in the selected feed channels. It is optional and can be granted only in those channels.
* send ephemeral command responses

## Privacy and data

PokéPost stores the profile information users submit through `/post setup` and related commands.

This may include:

* Discord user ID
* Pokémon GO username
* Pokémon GO trainer code
* Vivillon pattern
* optional Campfire username
* additional trainer codes
* republishing preference
* message references needed to manage public posts

PokéPost is not designed as a general-purpose message archive.

## Support development

PokéPost is built as an open source community tool.

If it helps your server, you can support further development by voting for the bot when voting pages are available, contributing feedback or issues on GitHub, or supporting the developer here:

### Remove a public profile post

`/post admin remove user:<@mention or user ID>` requires Manage Messages in the
command channel and is restricted to the configured home server. The command
accepts a raw user ID so a post can be removed even if Discord cannot display its
owner. It removes only the bot's stored public post and clears its message reference;
the saved profile, codes and republishing preference remain. Automatic bumping skips
removed posts, including bumps already selected before removal. A row lock serializes
bumping with moderator removal/region correction.

The private response confirms the result and the moderation log records IDs and
outcome, without friend codes. This is not a posting ban: an owner can publish again
through the existing profile commands, and a moderator's region correction can also
recreate the post. Followed/crossposted copies are not independently deleted by this
command. If the Discord deletion succeeds but database confirmation fails, the reply
requests a retry to finish disabling bumping. A missing post is safe to remove again.

Automatic bump sends use an enforced nonce derived from the replaced message ID to prevent duplicate creation on short Discord API retries. Discord deduplicates these nonces for a few minutes; this is not a permanent exactly-once guarantee and does not remove pre-existing duplicate posts.

## Vivillon groups and emoji decisions

See [VIVILLON-STRUCTURE.md](VIVILLON-STRUCTURE.md) for the current Tundraheim group mapping, post emojis and agreed future routing direction. It supersedes earlier candidate lists.

## Automatic bump cadence

With BUMP_ENABLED=true, International runs hourly and Tundra every 3 hours during
one transition sweep for the September 2026 Vivillon emoji update. Each channel
then automatically switches to its normal cadence: International every 4 hours,
Tundra every 8 hours. Exactly one eligible profile is selected per run. International
uses whole-hour UTC slots; Tundra uses UTC slots offset by 30 minutes. A shared
30-minute minimum gap also separates delayed sends across the two feeds.

The scheduler creates poke_post_bump_runs and poke_post_bump_queue tables on first
startup. These retain the original active-post queue and completion across restarts.
Transition selects oldest last_bumped_at first (never-bumped first); normal operation
selects randomly. Replacement posts and removals are dropped from the queue. New
profiles are already rendered with current emojis and are not added to the sweep.
Existing BUMP_TUNDRA_COOLDOWN_DAYS (default 5) and
BUMP_INTERNATIONAL_COOLDOWN_DAYS (default 3) remain in force, so the sweep can wait
for recent profiles to become eligible. Failed sends remain pending.

BUMP_*_INTERVAL_HOURS and BUMP_*_COUNT_PER_RUN are superseded by this schedule;
changing those old variables has no effect. No environment changes are required.
Startup schedules the next future slot without an immediate or catch-up bump.
A database advisory lock serializes scheduler instances, and existing per-profile
locking and short-retry nonce protection still apply. Auto-bumps suppress mentions
and push notifications. Historical duplicate messages are not cleaned up by this job.

## Removing an older profile copy

The optional message field in `/post admin remove` accepts a full Discord message
link or a message ID. Use a full link when the copy is in another channel or the
saved profile no longer exists. A bare ID uses the saved profile channel, or the
command channel when no profile exists.

The bot verifies that the selected message was posted by PokéPost and that its
copy button identifies the requested profile owner. The owner does not need to
be a server member. Removing a selected older copy leaves a different active post
unchanged. Removing the active post also disables its automatic bumping. This
option does not scan for other copies or block future posting.
